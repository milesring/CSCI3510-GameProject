# CSCI3510-GameProject
Semester long game project for CSCI3510 - Advanced Game Design at the University of Nebraska at Omaha  
Fall 2017  
  
Made in Unity  
  
This game was originally intended to be an attempt at making our own Battle Royale game. Our team eventually dwindled down to 3 members and the final cut for our AI was never finished.
